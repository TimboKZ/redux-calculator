# Redux Calculator
A simple calculator app written in TypeScript (TSX to be precise) using React and Redux. I wrote it as an exercise to familiarise myself with Redux so if you are planning to use this repository as a reference please keep in mind that there might be some incorrect implementations in the code. You can find some more info in [this article](getting-started-with-redux-react).

> I gave up on trying to make `react-hot-loader` v3.0 work with TypeScript so this project does not use hot loading, which is shameful but not the end of the world.
